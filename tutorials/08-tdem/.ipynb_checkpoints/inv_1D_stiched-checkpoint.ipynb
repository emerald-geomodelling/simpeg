    "a stitched 1D inversion on a 3D TDEM (time-domain electromagnetic) dataset. That is, we recover a local 1D\n",
    "conductivity model for each sounding. In this tutorial, we focus on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Defining receivers, sources and the survey for the stitched 1D case\n",
    "    - Implementing a regularization that connects nearby 1D vertical conductivity profiles\n",
    "    - Recovering a stitched model composed of a 1D vertical conductivity profile at each sounding location\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sounding, the survey geometry consisted of horizontal loop source\n",
    "with a radius of 10 m, located 30 m above the Earth's surface. The receiver\n",
    "measured the vertical component of db/dt at the loop's centre.\n",
