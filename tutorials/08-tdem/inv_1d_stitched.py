"""
Stitched 1D Time-Domain Inversion
=================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromangetics.time_domain_1d* to perform
a stitched 1D inversion on a 3D TDEM (time-domain electromagnetic) dataset. That is, we recover a local 1D
conductivity model for each sounding. In this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - Defining receivers, sources and the survey for the stitched 1D case
    - Implementing a regularization that connects nearby 1D vertical conductivity profiles
    - Recovering a stitched model composed of a 1D vertical conductivity profile at each sounding location

For each sounding, the survey geometry consisted of horizontal loop source
with a radius of 10 m, located 30 m above the Earth's surface. The receiver
measured the vertical component of db/dt at the loop's centre.

# Define a Mapping and a Starting/Reference Model
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# When defining a starting or reference model, it is important to realize that
# the total number of conductivity required is the number of layers times the
# number of soundings. To keep the tutorial simple, we will invert for the
# log-conductivity. Where *mi* is a 1D array  representing the 1D conductivity
# model for sounding *i*, the 1D array containing all 1D conductivity models is
# organized as [m1,m2,m3,...].

# Define Inverse Problem

#
# The inverse problem is defined by 3 things:
#
#     1) Data Misfit: a measure of how well our recovered model explains the field data
#     2) Regularization: constraints placed on the recovered model and a priori information
#     3) Optimization: the numerical approach used to solve the inverse problem
#
#

# Define the data misfit. Here the data misfit is the L2 norm of the weighted
# residual between the observed data and the data predicted for a given model.
# The weighting is defined by the reciprocal of the uncertainties.
dmis = data_misfit.L2DataMisfit(simulation=simulation, data=data_object)

# Define the regularization (model objective function). Here we use a laterally
# constrained regularization. This regularization connects the 1D models of
# nearby soundings and ensure lateral changes in electrical conductivity are
# sufficiently smooth.

# Define Inversion Directives

#

# Defining a starting value for the trade-off parameter (beta) between the data
# misfit and the regularization.
